# Eaton IoT Platform Sample Application

This application is designed to be a gentle introduction to the Eaton IoT Platform.

For tutorials that explain how to use this application as a starting point for your project please see the platform [tutorials].

Visit the IoT team's [blog] to keep up to date with all of the latest developments in Eaton's IoT platform.

# Overview

The application provides a site with access to web pages displaying time series data and real time values from your device.

The application exercises the IoT platform's WebAPI to provide information about the device, retrieve the devices channels and to retrieve the actual data values being displayed.

The application is actually communicating with your Beagle Bones Black device using the actual IoT platform and the data being displayed is not simulated in any way.
